## Step 9: Use emphasis

Great job with those lists! Let's try something new. You can use **bold** and _italic_ text in Markdown. There are a couple of ways to create emphasis.

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

I have some really **awesome abilities** that I am writing out in the following list. I am using the emphasis markdown tags as instructed.
* **Writing skills**
* *HTML and CSS skills*
* _**COBOL** programming skills_
